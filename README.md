So for those who don't know, Haxmas was a super cool YSWS that just ended where for 12 days there was a new workshop each day, and for each day you completed, you had the choice between a prize, or some snowflakes which you could spend in the shop. There wasn't one place where all the prizes were, so I made a simple app where you can put in what days you did and it will add up all your prizes!
